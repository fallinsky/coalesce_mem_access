Basic loop: Access a memory location and then do something before the next memory access.
            Distance is the stuff that separates these memory accesses.
With coalescing, several memory accesses are performed at the same time.
Distance between memory accesses is dominated by cpu cycles for math that is dependent on the memory that was accessed
